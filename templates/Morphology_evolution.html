                <br>
                  <p>
                    The morpholgy of a robot describes the physical characteristics of
                    the robot's body, such as the size and shape of the body, the number
                    and placing of components that aid in the robot's locomotion. In this
                    apprach, the Evolutionary Robotics principles are used the aid in evolving
                    the robot's morphology, keeping the robot's predefined controller static.
                  </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      There has been an increase in work aimed at using robot
                      teams to complete a range of non-trivial collective behaviour
                      tasks. The task we pay particular attention to is a search and
                      retrieval (foraging) task. The task is constructed such that
                      the team of robots have to make use of work cooperatively
                      to efficiently complete the task. In the real world, such a
                      task would involve a significant amount of noise and incomplete
                      information which would require the team of robots to
                      adapt to the environment through a suitable learning process.
                      We would thus expect our team of robots to exhibit
                      some form of Artificial Intelligence. The concepts
                      of Evolutionary Computation are used to achieve this
                      goal, which builds the foundations of Evolutionary Robotics.

                      The morhoplogy of our robots that will be evolved is the sensor configuration. This
                      describes where and how many sensors will be placed on he robots. There are five parameters
                      that will be evolved.

                  <h2>Methods and Implementation</h2>
                  <p>
                      The morphology of the agents was evolved using a Genetic Algorithm
                      and a heuristc based controller was constructed to aid in maximum
                      exploration of the environment as well as minimal collisions between
                      the agents and objects in the environment (exluding the resource objects).
                  </p>

                  <h2>Experiments</h2>
                  <p>
                    The morphology evolution approach was tested in a the simulation environment.
                    A single simulation consists of placing the agents in the simulation environment
                    and they have a certain amount of time to complete the foraging task. These
                    simulations were run for 250 generations in the evolutionary algorithm -
                    thus completing a single experiment. 20 of these experiments were run for each
                    configuration type. Three experiment configuration types were defined, in order
                    to test for different levels of cooperation between the agents
                  </p>

                  <dl>
                    <dt>Small configuration</dt>
                    <dd>
                      This configuration required very little cooperation between agents in order to
                      efficiently complete the task. There are 10 small, 5 medium, and 0 large boxes.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Medium Configuration</dt>
                    <dd>
                      This configuration required the some cooperation between agents in order to
                      efficiently complete the task. There are 5 small, 5 medium, and 5 large boxes.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Large Configuration</dt>
                    <dd>
                      his configuration required the a large amount of cooperation between agents in order to
                      efficiently complete the task. There are 0 small, 5 medium, and 10 large boxes.
                    </dd>

                  <h2>Results</h2>
                  <p>
                    This approach gave better solutions for experiments that required the least amount of cooperation.

                        The average of the best team fitness scores for each
