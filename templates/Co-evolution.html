                        <h2>A Co-Evolution Apprach</h2>

                        <p>
                            A Robot Agent is made up of a morphology and a controller - a body and a brain. Traditionally, robot agents have been designed by hand : a careful design of the body of a robot and a set of guidance heuristics to guide the robot to complete a task.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Evolutionary Computing and Machine Learning is an Artificial Intelligence technique in which computers and machinery learn to complete a task through experience. Experience is generated with large amount of data and the machines learn with this data. A simple example is a Reinforcement Learning approach - when a robot agent makes a mistake - it is punished and when it does an act which gives some achievement - the robot agent is rewarded. Robot agents commit acts which maximise achievement and minimise punishment and so the Robot agent learns (by itself) to complete a task.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The Co-Evolution takes the evolutionary approach a step further. It uses evolutionary computation to adapt the morphology AND the controller of a robot agent. The Morphology is made up of a set of sensors and each sensor has the following parameters:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bearing : The positioning of the sensor on the robot agent.</li>
                                <li>Field of View : The value of the angle between the 2 edges.</li>
                                <li>Orientation : The anglular offset between the perpendicular line drawn from the centre of the circle and the centre of a sensorâ€™s vision</li>
                                <li>Range : The distance a robot sensor can sense an object.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            Therefore, in addition to adapting the controller of a robot agent - the morphology (the set of sensors and its paramters) were also evolved to find an optimal robot agent to complete the task.                         
                            </P>
                            <h2>Methods and Implementation</h2>
                            <p>
                                The Controller of the robot agent was implemeneted using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The typical structure of an ANN has a set of input nodes, a hidden layer of nodes and an output layer of nodes. Given the configuration of the Khepera robot agent - the inputs into the ANN are the sensory readings and the 2 output nodes are the drivers of the two motors to drive the two wheels of the Khepera Robot.
                                <br>
                                NEAT (Neuro Evolution for Augmenting topologies) is a great method to train an Artificial Neural Network. NEAT adapts the weights AND the topology of an Artificial Neural Network. This is an amazing approach because it allows one to change thes stucture of an Artificial Neural Network.
